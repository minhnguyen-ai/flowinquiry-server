# 🤝 How to Contribute to FlowInquiry

FlowInquiry is a community-driven project, and every contribution—big or small—helps us grow. You don’t need to write code to make a meaningful impact. There are many valuable ways to contribute, and all contributions are equally appreciated.

## 🌟 Ways to Contribute

### ⭐ Star the Project on GitHub

Giving the repository a star helps us gain visibility and shows your support for the project.

### 📢 Spread the Word

Introduce FlowInquiry to your friends, colleagues, or audience. Share it on social media, mention it in a blog post, or even add it to your developer toolkit recommendations.

### 🎥 Create Content

Make a YouTube video, demo, or tutorial showing how to use FlowInquiry. Content like this helps new users understand the product and builds trust in the community.

### 🧪 Use It and Give Feedback

Try out FlowInquiry in your projects. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub. User feedback helps us improve faster and build what truly matters.

### 📝 Improve Documentation

Found a typo? Want to clarify something? Help us make the docs better for everyone. Clear documentation is just as important as the code.

### 🌍 Help with localization

Speak another language? You can help make FlowInquiry more accessible by translating the user interface. No coding needed — just edit a JSON file with the correct translations. Even small contributions (like fixing a single phrase) make a big difference for global users.
