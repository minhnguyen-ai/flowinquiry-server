### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="flowinquiry-frontend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

* `public` contains static assets, such as files and images, served by Next.js
* `scripts` Includes useful scripts for validating environment settings, setting up project environment variables, and more
* `src` the FlowInquiry's frontend source code

#### Checking environments

FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the valid_checks.sh script located in the scripts folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

```bash
➜  FlowInquiry-frontend git:(main) scripts/valid_checks.sh
Running node_check.sh...
Node.js version: 20.14.0
Node.js version is 20.14.0, which is greater than or equal to 18.
node_check.sh succeeded.
Running pnpm_check.sh...
pnpm is installed.
pnpm version: 9.7.0
pnpm_check.sh succeeded.
Your environments settings satisfy FlowInquiry's conditions
```

#### Setup scripts

You will need to run the following scripts:
* `scripts/init_git_hooks.sh`: Sets up a git hook to automatically format and check code logic each time you commit changes.

* `scripts/init_environments.sh`: Create a new `.env.local` file, which is used by the Next.js application to read predefined environment variables

<Callout emoji="💡">
  You can run the `scripts/all.sh` script, which will check your environment settings and perform the necessary configurations, eliminating the need to run multiple scripts individually
</Callout>
