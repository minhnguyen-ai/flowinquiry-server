# Getting started

FlowInquiry back-end is a spring boot application, and it has several components:

- Spring Data
- Spring REST
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- Liquibase

FlowInquiry uses Gradle as its build tool and includes the Gradle wrapper in the distribution, so there's no need to install Gradle separately.

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="flowinquiry-server" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="server" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="commons" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tools" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `scripts` Includes useful scripts for validating environment settings, setting up project environment variables, and more
- `server` the FlowInquiry server sources
- `commons` the common codebase for FlowInquiry backend
- `tools` extra tools for FlowInquiry server such as liquibase database migration scripts and more

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry backend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file .env.local. FlowInquiry offers two options for creating this configuration file:

- Using Bash Scripts: Users can run provided Bash scripts, which prompt for inputs, validate the information, and then automatically generate the configuration file.
- Editing a Template Manually: A template configuration file (.env.local.example) is provided, allowing users to manually edit and create their .env.local file. This option is recommended for Windows users who cannot run Bash scripts.

        #### Checking environments

        FlowInquiry backend requires Java, Docker is already installed. You can run the `valid_checks.sh` script located in the scripts folder to verify
        if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry-server scripts/valid_checks.sh
        Running java_check.sh...
        Java Version Information:
        openjdk version "21.0.5" 2024-10-15 LTS
        OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS)
        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

        Java Vendor: Eclipse Adoptium
        Java Runtime Environment: OpenJDK Runtime Environment
        Java VM Name: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM
        Java Home: /usr
        Java version is 21, which is greater than or equal to 21.
        java_check.sh succeeded.
        Running docker_check.sh...
        docker_check.sh succeeded.
        Your environments settings satisfy FlowInquiry's conditions
        ```
        #### Setup scripts

        You will need to run the following scripts:

        `scripts/init_git_hooks.sh`: Sets up a git hook to automatically format and check code logic each time you commit changes.

        `scripts/create_secrets.sh`: Create secrets stored in the `.env.local` file, which is used by the FlowInquiry server

        <Callout emoji="💡">
            You can run the `scripts/all.sh` script, which will check your environment
            settings and perform the necessary configurations, eliminating the need to run
            multiple scripts individually
        </Callout>

        #### Sending email

        To use FlowInquiry's email features, such as sending activation emails to users or reminders about upcoming tasks, you'll need an SMTP account. You can configure this with providers like Gmail, Amazon SES, or any SMTP service. Please note that this email setup is intended for use in a local environment only.

        Run the script `scripts/mail_config.sh`, it will ask you the STMP information, and then it writes all to the local file `.env.local`

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) ✗ scripts/mail_config.sh
        Enter your SMTP host: smtp.gmail.com
        Enter your SMTP port: 587
        Enter your username: username
        Enter your password:  password
        Does SMTP require STARTTLS (y/n)? y
        Please enter the email address that will be used as the sender for outgoing emails: noreply@flowinquiry.io
        Please enter the base URL that will be used for the email template: http://localhost:3000
        Backup of .env.local created as .env.local.backup
        Configuration has been saved to .env.local
        ```

        <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
            To use your Google credentials to send a test email, you cannot use your
            regular email password. Instead, you'll need to generate an App Password. For
            detailed instructions, see the guide at

            Rename the file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, and edit the file content per instructions inline

### Run application

#### Run postgres database

FlowInquiry uses PostgreSQL as its database and provides pre-configured PostgreSQL settings. You need to run the database before starting the FlowInquiry server.
Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine, then run the command `docker compose -f docker/services.yml` up to start the database

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) docker compose -f docker/services.yml up
[+] Running 1/0
 ✔ Container flowinquiry-postgresql-1  Created                                                                                                                                                                        0.0s

```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Be sure to run the scripts/all.sh or scripts/create_secrets.sh script before
  starting the PostgreSQL database, as they will generate a new PostgreSQL
  password and store it in the .env.local file, which the PostgreSQL container
  relies on.
</Callout>

#### Run flowinquiry server

<Tabs items={['Gradle', 'IntelliJ']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        From the root folder, run the command `./gradlew :server:bootRun`

        ```bash

        You can import the FlowInquiry server into IntelliJ as a Gradle project. Once imported, run the `io.flowinquiry.FlowInquiryApp` class as a standalone Java application

        ![IntelliJ](/images/flowinquiry_intellij.png)

        As similar than gradle command, it will take some time before the server APIs are accessible on the default port `8080`
